THE DASH:
🚀 Exploring a Sale performance with Data! 📈📊
I recently worked on a bike company 🏍️ dataset analysis and created this interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard to uncover insights about the company’s sales performance.

🔎 KEY PERFORMANCES:
💠 The dataset ranged from 2009 to 2012 in 5 different countries(USA, Canada, Mexico, France and Germany). The sales were categorized into 5 which can be found on the dashboard below. The key performances are discussed below ⬇️ 

📌 NO OF GOODS SOLD: The company made total sales of products of 1125824 which is of 21.19% decrease in YoY in the present year (2012)
 📌SALES– The total sales made across 4 years by the company is $127,931,598.5 which is of 36.15% decrease in YoY in the present year (2012)
 📌 Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS) – $101,832,648.0 were made on goods sold which is of 37.39% decrease in YoY in the present year (2012)
 📌 Total Profit– The company made a total profit of $26,098,950.5 which it’s YoY is 31.27% decrease in the present year (2012)

🧐 Why YoY?

Year-over-Year (YoY) refers to a comparison of data or metrics over a 12-month period, typically used to measure growth, change, or trends. This helps to identify the significant impact of operations of the period of a year and track back growth or decrease in performance. With YoY, the sales team can identify their strengths or limitations and use this as a guide to improve performance.

▶️ The two dashboards that made up this report analysis showed the visualization and the insights derived from the analysis.

Frame 1: shows the data visualization of the data 
Frame 2: serves as insight into the analysis and also pointing to directions that the sales team can look into to maximize profit for the company.

💡 Why This Dashboard?
Using Microsoft Excel, I designed this interactive dashboard with filter for sales year which allowing users to explore the sale performance trends visually of the years.

This project helped me refine my data visualization skills and gain deeper insights into sales performance analysis trends. Would love to hear your thoughts! 💭
