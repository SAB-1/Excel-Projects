# Excel-Projects

The files here are projects analyzed with Microsoft Excel. These projects use the best analytical methods to gain proper insights and trends from the datasets.

## Analytical Methods Used

ðŸŸ¢ **Data Wrangling**: This consists of the ETL process, which allows the dataset to be in the best form for analysis.

ðŸŸ¢ **ETL Process**: ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. Datasets are extracted from sources (in these projects, many were picked from the system folder 
    because they had been downloaded. Some were obtained from the web, i.e., web scraping).

- **Extract**: Datasets are gathered from various sources.
- **Transform**: This is the data cleaning phase, which helps to get data to its best form for analysis.
- **Load**: The data is ready for analysis. In Excel, this phase enables me to pick columns ready for analysis into a pivot table and perform statistical
-    and numerical analysis on the datasets.

Feel free to explore the projects and see the insights derived from the data!
